## To-Do
- optimizing and cleaning up current state (make it stage ready for the showcase and easier to read for you and the judges) (@Patrick.Hartmann)
- Weather detection (@Aarthi Alagammai)

#### Open:
- Sign detection for german highway, if we find a good dataset (…)
- Improvement of car detection, because the current one from OpenVino is never detecting the car on the right lane (…)
- Converting models to IR and applying them (…)
- multithreading for the models, to increase execution time (…)
- better text-recognition (very poor results, we only have one result that is actually displaying the right text)
